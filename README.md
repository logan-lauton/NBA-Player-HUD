### About Me
I am a Senior at [Marquette University](https://www.marquette.edu/data-science/) pursuing a bachelors of science in data science, with minor areas in computer science, economics, & mathematics. Over my academic career at Marquette I have learned how to use many coding languages such as Python, Java, R, SQL, and more all to help me further my understanding of computational analysis. This repo, along with my others, are simply to showcase my projects and other fun activities that exemplify the ucurrent nderstanding that I have in the data science field.

### About this Repository
This repository holds the code and data used for my [R Shiny App](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) that I am building in my visual analytics course at [Marquette University](https://www.marquette.edu/data-science/). The app is a NBA Player HUD which allows users to effortlessly analyze key statistics, explore data ranging over a players entire career, or explore box scores from the previous twenty seasons! All of the data can be found convinetly in this Repository, however to see how the data was scraped feel free to view my [NBA Webscrape](https://github.com/logan-lauton/nba_webscrape) repository which shows how the data was scraped and processed before being imported to R.
