# app v1.3

In this update, I fixed memory issues that I have been dealing with by first moving exclusively to coding on [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud) and by filtering the data to only include the past 20 years, see [global.R](https://github.com/logan-lauton/NBA-Player-HUD/blob/main/iterations/app-v1.3/global.R), as the memory issue persisted on Posit Cloud. After that was complete, I next preceded to add in the [GGPlot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) which would display FT% & FG% over a players career, and while doing this I noticed an issue. Players who played on multiple teams in a single season would have skewed data for said season, for example I notice Ray Allen's PPG was popping up in the 60s for his 2003 season, when in reality it was around 22, so to fix this I summed by the category multiplied by games played and divided by the total number of games played, see [app.R](https://github.com/logan-lauton/NBA-Player-HUD/blob/main/iterations/app-v1.3/app.R) for the code. In the next iteration I hope to update the Welcome tab, more specifically the .md file used in order to more accurately display the current features of the app.
