## app v1.1

In this updated version of app v1.0 I adjusted the table to fit the column properly, as well as having new filter abilities, such as adding the ability to change the season that is viewed, the team that is selected, and when clicking a player in the data table, a plot would be rendered to the right of the data table which allows users to view the players per game stats over their career. In the next itteration of the app, which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/logan-lauton/NBA-Player-HUD/blob/main/iterations/app-v1.2), I hope to add the ability to view all teams in a given season, as well as have an idea for how to plot players with less than or equal to two seasons in the league, as those players graphs have been difficult to determine the best method of visualization as there is neiter enough data for a proper stacked bar chart, nor enough data to plot a line graph.
