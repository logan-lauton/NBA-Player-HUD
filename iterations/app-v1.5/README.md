# app v1.5

In this iteration a lot of user testing occured, showing that certain values were not necessary for fantasy use, such as salary and team cap data, which was assumed, as well as box score data, which was not assumed. Furthermore the plots were said to be missing position averages, spots where players were injured, and hoverability.
In this iteratoin all of these changes were made based on user testing, and thus reflect what users want in the app. I'll be working in building the player comparisson tab over the next week as the app is due to be complete, in some form, by May 7, 2023.
