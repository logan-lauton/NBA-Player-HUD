# app v1.4  

In this update most of what I did was exploring the options, in [global.R](https://github.com/logan-lauton/NBA-Player-HUD/blob/main/iterations/app-v1.4/global.R), for the forecasting tab which, after carfeful consideration, seems to be impossible given time constraints. After fitting and removing outliers my best model had an $R^2_{Adj}$ of 0.9999863, or in other words this indicates that 99.999% of the variation in the output variables are explained by the input variables. Furthermore the RMSE of the best model was around 4.201, this indicates that on average, the predicted values differ from the actual values by approximately 4.201 units. After predicting values I had numerous values that were negative, implying that it was possible for a player to have negative points in a season, which is of course impossible. In the next update I will begin building a new tab which allows users to compare players visually.
