## app v1.0

In this prelimanery version of the app I first did some basic data cleaning, which can be seen in the global.R file, before I eventually began to build the apps UI and Server portions up in the  Single-file Style of coding an R Shiny app, I got a basic data table rendered that had purely basic functions avaliable to it and I had a basic md file for the Welcome page of the app. For further updates see the next [version](https://github.com/logan-lauton/NBA-Player-HUD/edit/main/iterations/app-v1.1)
